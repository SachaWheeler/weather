## Weather - A Personal Assistant Script

It uses a text-to-speech engine (connected to my Hi-fi) to inform me of important daily details.

## Features

At the top of every hour between 07:00 and 14:00, it provides a summary of:
- the date & time
- current weather conditions & temperature
- rain predictions (when it will start or end)
- sunrise & sunset times and number of hours of daylight
- how far are we into the current season
- any bank holidays or friends' birthdays in the next 7 days
- if any of my colleagues are on holiday today (from their shared calendar)
- if I have any meetings today and when
- and my upcoming calendar events.

## Motivation

I tend to get lost in my work in the morning, so this script serves as a gentle, informative assistant
to keep me on track.

## Example Output

This would be sent to a text-to-speech engine, which would read it aloud:
> Good morning.
> It is eight o clock on Friday the twenty-fifth of July.
> We are thirty-five days, or three eighths of the way into Summer, with sixty days left.
> It is seventeen degrees.
> Currently Partly Cloudy with wind speed of one meter per second from the North North West.
> A high of twenty-six and a low of sixteen degrees Celcius.
> Events today include Lizzies birthday.
> Your next appointment is Dev stand-up at eight thirty, followed by Team lunch at one oh clock.
> Sunset will be at eight fifty-nine for fifteen hours and forty-five minutes of daylight.
