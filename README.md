## Weather - A Personal Assistant Script

It uses a text-to-speech engine (connected to my Hi-fi) to inform me of important daily details.

## Features

At the top of every hour between 07:00 and 14:00, it provides a summary of:
- the date and time
- current weather conditions
- current temperature
- rain predictions
- sunrise and sunset times
- hours of daylight
- how far are we into the current season
- any bank holidays or friends' birthdays in the next 7 days
- if any of my colleagues are on holiday (from their shared calendar)
- if I have any meetings today and when
- and my upcoming calendar events.

## Motivation

I tend to get lost in my work in the morning, so this script serves as a gentle, informative assistant
to keep me on track.
