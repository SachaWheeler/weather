# Weather

This script runs on the hour, every hour between 07:00 and 14:00 and lets me know
(piped though a text-to-speech engine on a machine connected to my Hi-fi):

- the date and time
- current weather conditions
- current temperature
- rain predictions
- sunrise and sunset times
- hours of daylight
- how far are we into the current season
- any bank holidays or friends' birthdays in the next 7 days
- if any of my colleagues are on holiday (from their shared calendar)
- if I have any meetings today and when
- and my upcoming calendar events.

I tend to get lost in my work in the morning, so this is a gentle and informative assistant.
