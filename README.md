# Weather

This script runs on the hour, every hour between 07:00 and 14:00 and lets me know
(piped though a text-to-speech engine on a machine connected to my Hi-fi)
the date, time, weather, temperature, rain prediction, hours of the day progress through the season,
and my upcoming calendar events.

I tend to get lost in my work in the mornings, so this is a gentle and informative assistant.
