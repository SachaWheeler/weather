# Weather

This script runs on the hour, every hour between 07:00 and 14:00 and lets me know
(piped though a text-to-speech engine on a machine connected to my Hi-fi):

- the date
- the time
- current weather conditions
- current temperature
- rain prediction with time
- hours of daylight
- progress through the season,
- and my upcoming calendar events.

I tend to get lost in my work in the mornings, so this is a gentle and informative assistant.
